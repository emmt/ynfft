YNFFT is a Yorick plugin for NFFT (nonequispaced fast Fourier transform).

Installation
============

1. Make sure you have installed the NFFT library from
   <http://www-user.tu-chemnitz.de/~potts/nfft/>, the FFTW library from
   <http://www.fftw.org/> and Yorick from <http://yorick.github.com/>.

2. Go to the YNFFT directory (where this README file is located):

   > cd $DIR/ynfft-$VERSION

3. Edit the file "Makefile" and check the values of the variables PKG_DEPLIBS,
   PKG_CFLAGS and PKG_LDFLAGS; for instance, assuming PREFIX is a variable
   with the top directory where FFTW and NFFT libraries are installed:

   PKG_DEPLIBS=-L$(PREFIX)/lib -lnfft3 -lfftw3
   PKG_CFLAGS=-I$(PREFIX)/include
   PKG_LDFLAGS=

4. Update the paths in the file "Makefile" for compilation by executing the
   following command:

   > yorick -batch make.i

   where "yorick" can be replaced by the full path to your Yorick interpreter
   if not installed in a standard location.

5. Optionally, check the plugin:

   > make tests

   You may have to set some environment variable for the dynamic loader
   (LD_LIBRARY_PATH on Linux) if the NFFT library is installed in a
   non-standard location, e.g.:

   > LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PREFIX/lib make tests

6. Finally, install the plugin:

   > make install
